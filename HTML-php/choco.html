                What I truly love is chocolate.Infact I love all sorts of chocolate 
                ,be it DARK CHOCOLATE ,milky or white ,I just love it.activeThe best part of chocolate is the amazing feel when it dissolves into your mouth.
                A chocolate with hazelnuts and peanuts sure is a treat and thats why Snickers has always been my 
                first priority.
